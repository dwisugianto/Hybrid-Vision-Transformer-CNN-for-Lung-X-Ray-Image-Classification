# Hybrid-Vision-Transformer-CNN-for-Lung-X-Ray-Image-Classification
This project implements a hybrid model combining Vision Transformer (ViT) and CNN (ResNet-18) for lung X-ray image classification. The model is designed to improve classification performance by leveraging ViT’s ability to capture global dependencies and CNN’s strength in extracting local features.
